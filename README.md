*I use Tableau in my current position to create dashboards and data stories. The projects for my current work contain sensitive data. Therefore, the projects presented here are from my University work.*

This repository contains a pdf presentation of 3 Tableau sample projects that I have worked on. <br>


## Projects:
**1.	Beer, Pretzels, and Non-Pretzels Dashboard** <br>
This was a mini-project to create a dashboard comparing the sales of beer, pretzels, and non-pretzels. <br><br>
**2.	On-Time Performance of United Airlines** <br>
This project involved using the Bureau of Transportation Statistics domestic flight data from 2018 to analyze departure delays of United Airlines. The data set included 7,213,446 records and 111 variables. The visualizations included are my contribution to the team's final Tableau story. <br><br>
**3.	Who Survived the Titanic?** <br>
This was another mini-project to create a story using the classic Titanic survivor data set analyzing what passengers survived this fateful trip.<br><br>
